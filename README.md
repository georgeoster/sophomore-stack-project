ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:

create and test a class for a stack of objects. 
You may use any object class of your choice as the data for the stack.   
The instances of the class should have at least one field that distinguishes them form other instances of the class (key field).


Your stack class should contain a stack pointer to the first element in the stack and the size of the stack as stack properties.
You should have methods to:

instantiate a null stack

push  - add an element to the top of the stack 

pop – remove an element from the top of the stack 

return stack size 

a boolean isEmpty method


You will need to create a class of node for the data in the stack, which we call a stackElement.
Each stackElement should have a data element, a pointer to the next element, and the following methods:

A null constructor

An initializing constructor (instantiates a  stackElement from a data element) 

set and get methods for the data elements

return the data in a stack element 

set the pointer to the next element   

return the pointer to the next element  

This assignment requires four classes – Stack, StackFrame, the data object class, and a class for your test project.
